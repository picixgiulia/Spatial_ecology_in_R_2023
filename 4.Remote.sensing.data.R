There is a difference between satellite images (scanner) and photographs.
The earth is not a sphere, it's a Geoid: surface always perpendicular to the gravity force and is approximating the sea level.
Since it is not a geometrical shape, the Geoid cannot be used to do measurements, instead we use an ellipsoid.
We use different ellipsoid based on the region of the world considered, to be the most similar as possible to the real surface.
Example: NAD27 for USA, ED50 for Italy.
