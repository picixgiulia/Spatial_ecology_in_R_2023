# Here i can write anything i want. In this way R cannot run this line, it is just a comment to explain what is happening.

# R as a calculator 
2 + 3 # if you copy paste this in R it will calculate the result

# you can assign a subpart of the code to an object 
Zima <- 2 + 3
# now if you write Zima in R and run the code it will appear 5
Duccio <- 5 + 3 
# zima*duccio will calculate 48, and we can save it as an object
final <- zima*duccio
