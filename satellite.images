# How do satellite images work?
The reflectance is a ratio between incident light (flow of energy) and the radiant flux (reflected energy). 
If the reflected energy is zero, there is an 100% absorption of the incident energy.
In the green there is a high reflectance and low absorption.
Range between 0 and 2035.
