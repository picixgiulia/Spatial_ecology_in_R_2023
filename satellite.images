# How do satellite images work?
The reflectance is a ratio between incident light (flow of energy) and the radiant flux (reflected energy). 
If the reflected energy is zero, there is an 100% absorption of the incident energy.
In the green there is a high reflectance and low absorption.
Range between 0 and 2035.

# RGB function
red b4, green b3, blue b2 (+b8) -> need all to make a visible image, to recreate the image in the exact same colors of "reality"
