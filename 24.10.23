# Ecosystems and remote sensing
Ecosystems are very big, hard to collect enough data:
- Establish plots of the same dimensions and take samples
- Use remote sensing -> satelite images
The european state agency (Europe) and Nasa (US) own the satelites around the globe.
Remote sensing record colours, measure the reflectance of objects at different wavelenghts (nanometers).
Every number represents a colour (legend), amount of reflectance in each unit (pixel = smallest unit of an image).

Colours are actially waves (light).
Newton born in 1642, same year Galileo died.
Newton described light as different wavelenghts. The visible light is just a small part.
Remote sensing can detect other wavelenghts as well.
Gamma ray - xray - ultraviolet (insect see the world through this) - VISIBLE - infrared - microwave - radio
[Blue smaller wavelenght, red bigger wavelenghts]

We can take a sensor put it on a drone/satelite and make it fly through a landscape, 
obtaining an image of different bands (many layers of reflectance of different wavelenghts).
