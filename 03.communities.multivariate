# Detrended correspondence analysis with 26 segments.
# Rescaling of axes with 4 iterations.
# what we need to know is the length of the new axis, how log is the range inside each axies,
# we can use this data to scale the analysis
# To obtain the range and percentage of data in each axis (graph on note)
